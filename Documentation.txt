---Explaination and Flow of the Application---

In package.json the 'main' is set to server.js and 
'start' key in 'the scripts' is also set to 'node ./server.js' by which
when typed 'npm start' in terminal the server starts.

so the flow begins with server.js

> server.js --> configs (server.config.js)
it gets the port from server.config which got if from '.env' file

> server.js --> models (index.js)
it gets the db object which it uses to be in sync with MySql

> different Application's .route files are registered along with the express 'app'
those .route files contain the endpoints

> depending upon the url ,corresponding endpoint is hit
lets say 'localhost:8080/categories'

> In .route file of categories 
> category.route.js --> validators(category_name_validator)

Depending upon the url and the method the corresponding controller function is called
> category.route.js --> controllers(category.controller)

These controllers only handle req,res and trigger the corresponding function of category.service
which interacts with db
> category.controller --> services(category.service)
> category.service --> MySql

Response
> MySql --> category.service --> category.controller --> User
